# Neural-Network-Modelling-of-Cognition
Connectionist Networks for experimental neurology and cognition in MATLAB

Neural Networks in this repositiory demonstrate basic theories of connectionist neuro-cognition including: Modeling internal representations, Autoassociators that model human catagorization and Learning English Past Tense using Perceptrons.
